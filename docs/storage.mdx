## Data Storage & Persistence

The system supports multiple data stores to handle both lightweight development workflows and production-scale deployments.

   >**SQLite** is used for local development and simple, single-node workflows where minimal setup and portability are required.

    >**PostgreSQL** is recommended for production environments, supporting multi-tenant architectures, higher concurrency,
    and robust data integrity.

The data store persists all critical operational information, including:

>Workflow state to enable recovery, retries, and resumable execution

>Agent decisions for traceability and debugging

>Human approvals to support human-in-the-loop workflows

>Tool outputs generated during task execution

>Audit logs for compliance, monitoring, and observability

>Context and memory snapshots to maintain continuity across agent runs

This persistence layer ensures reliability, transparency, and full lifecycle visibility across all agent workflows.
