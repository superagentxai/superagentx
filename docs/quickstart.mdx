## Introduction
This simple walkthrough will help you get started with building powerful applications using SuperAgentX in just a few steps.<br />

>**1. Installation:** How to install SuperAgentX on your system.<br />
**2. Create an Application:** Set up a new SuperAgentX project with the basic structure.<br />
**3. Virtual Environment Setup:** How to create and configure a Python virtual environment for your project.<br />
**4. Building a Use Case:** Customizing the pipe.py file to fit your application's needs.<br />
**5. Run the Application:** Finally, how to execute your new project with a simple command.

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install superagentx
```

<Note>
Note: <br />
After installation, the `superagentx-cli` will be available in the path `~/.local/bin` on `linux`. You may need to add
this to your environment's path variable.
</Note>

## Create an Application
To create a new `superagentx` project, run the following command in your terminal. This will prompt you to create
project with the basic structure set up for your `superagentx`.

```shell
$ superagentx-cli create
```

### Follow the steps
```shell
# First you have to give a application name or folder name.
Enter application name: Content Creator

# Then you have to enter pipe name or it will take a default application name.
Enter pipe name. Default is application name []: Story

# Next you have to give any one of option given below or it be take a default value all.
Enter one of the option (all, console, websocket, rest) [all]: all
```

After your inputs the `superagentx-cli` create a application like a below structure.

```shell
App Name ✈️ Content Creator
Pacakge Name 📦 content_creator
Pipe Name 🎢 story
App Type 🛠️ all

Creating app at /home/ben/Content Creator
Creating toml file at /home/ben/Content Creator/pyproject.toml
Creating readme file at /home/ben/Content Creator/README.md
Creating pipe file at /home/ben/Content Creator/content_creator/pipe.py
Your app type selection contains `websocket`, `rest api` option(s).

Enter auth token for `websocket`, `rest api` [098765432asdfghjk09876543]:
Creating config file at /home/ben/Content Creator/content_creator/config.py
Creating iopipe file at /home/ben/Content Creator/content_creator/iopipe.py
Creating wspipe file at /home/ben/Content Creator/content_creator/wspipe.py
Creating restpipe file at /home/ben/Content Creator/content_creator/restpipe.py
```

### Virtual Environment Setup
Now, you'll need to create a Python virtual environment for your project:

```shell
$ cd /home/ben/Content Creator
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install poetry
(venv) $ poetry install
```

### Build Your Use Case

If you're building a new use case, You need to modify the file at `/home/ben/Content Creator/content_creator/pipe.py`.
The path in this file will be generated based on the input you provide through the SuperAgentX application. In that
file you can do your changes.

### Step-by-Step process:

#### 1. Import Package
This method imports various components from the superagentx library.
```python

from superagentx.agent import Agent
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe
from superagentx.engine import Engine
from superagentx.llm import LLMClient
from superagentx.memory import Memory
from superagentx.prompt import PromptTemplate

from superagentx.handler import SerperDevToolHandler
from superagentx.handler import AIHandler
from superagentx_handlers import ScrapeHandler

```

#### 2. Define Method

This method `get_content_creator_pipe` initializes a content creation pipeline by configuring an LLM
(Large Language Model) client using OpenAI's API, for more detail about `LLMClient` refer <a href="llm" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python
async def get_content_creator_pipe() -> AgentXPipe:
    # LLM Configuration
    llm_config = {
        'llm_type': 'openai'
    }
    llm_client = LLMClient(llm_config=llm_config)
```

#### 3. Memory
This line enables `memory` functionality in the pipeline by configuring a `Memory` object that created `llm_client`
for storing and retrieving,  for more detail about `Memory` refer <a href="memory" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python
    # Enable Memory
    memory = Memory(memory_config={"llm_client": llm_client})
```

#### 4. Handler
This block initializes three handlers SerperDevToolHandler for interacting with external tools, ScrapeHandler for
web scraping tasks, and AIHandler which is configured with the llm_client to handle AI-driven operations, for more details
refer <a href="handler" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python
    # Example
    serper_handler = SerperDevToolHandler()
    crawler_handler = ScrapeHandler()
    ai_handler = AIHandler(
        llm=llm_client
    )
```

#### 5. PromptTemplate
This line creates an instance of PromptTemplate, which is used to define and manage prompt structures for the language model,
for more detail refer <a href="prompt" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python
    # Prompt Template
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate()
```

#### 6. Engine
This line initializes an `Engine` object for the `handlers`, combining it with the `llm_client` and `prompt_template`
to process tasks with the specified handler and prompt structure, for more details refer <a href="engine" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python
    # Example - Engine(s)
    serper_engine = Engine(
        handler=serper_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )
    crawler_engine = Engine(
        handler=crawler_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )
    ai_engine = Engine(
        handler=ai_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )
```

#### 7. Agent
This line creates an `Agent` with the role and goal to generate a list of URLs, and configuring it with the `llm_client`,
`prompt_template`, and `engine` to perform, for more details about `engine` refer <a href="agent" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python
    # Create Agent with serper, crawler, ai Engines execute in Parallel - Search Products from user prompts
    serper_agent = Agent(
        name='serper Agent',
        role=f'You are the website link extractor.',
        goal='Generate the list of website urls',
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[serper_engine]
    )

    crawler_agent = Agent(
        name='Crawler Agent',
        goal="Extract the content",
        role="You are the Content Extractor",
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[crawler_engine]
    )

    ai_agent = Agent(
        name='AI Agent',
        goal="Summarize the given content",
        role="You are the summarization.",
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[ai_engine]
    )
```

#### 8. AgentXPipe
This line sets up an AgentXPipe, combining multiple agents (serper_agent, crawler_agent, and ai_agent)
with shared memory to enable coordinated processing and communication between the agents, for more details
refer <a href="pipe" target='_blank'>here</a>.
```python

    # Pipe Interface to send it to public accessible interface (Cli Console / WebSocket / Restful API)
    pipe = AgentXPipe(
        agents=[serper_agent, crawler_agent, ai_agent],
        memory=memory
    )
```

### All Together
```python
from superagentx.agent import Agent
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe
from superagentx.engine import Engine
from superagentx.llm import LLMClient
from superagentx.memory import Memory
from superagentx.prompt import PromptTemplate

from superagentx.handler import SerperDevToolHandler
from superagentx.handler import AIHandler
from superagentx_handlers import ScrapeHandler

async def get_content_creator_pipe() -> AgentXPipe:
    # LLM Configuration
    llm_config = {
        'llm_type': 'openai'
    }
    llm_client = LLMClient(llm_config=llm_config)

    # Enable Memory
    memory = Memory(memory_config={"llm_client": llm_client})

    serper_handler = SerperDevToolHandler()
    crawler_handler = ScrapeHandler()
    ai_handler = AIHandler(
        llm=llm_client
    )

    # Prompt Template
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate()

    # Example - Engine(s)
    serper_engine = Engine(
        handler=serper_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )
    crawler_engine = Engine(
        handler=crawler_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )
    ai_engine = Engine(
        handler=ai_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )

    # Create Agent with serper, crawler, ai Engines execute in Parallel - Search Products from user prompts
    serper_agent = Agent(
        name='serper Agent',
        role=f'You are the website link extractor.',
        goal='Generate the list of website urls',
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[serper_engine]
    )

    crawler_agent = Agent(
        name='Crawler Agent',
        goal="Extract the content",
        role="You are the Content Extractor",
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[crawler_engine]
    )

    ai_agent = Agent(
        name='AI Agent',
        goal="Summarize the given content",
        role="You are the summarization.",
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[ai_engine]
    )

    # Pipe Interface to send it to public accessible interface (Cli Console / WebSocket / Restful API)
    pipe = AgentXPipe(
        agents=[serper_agent, crawler_agent, ai_agent],
        memory=memory
    )
    return pipe
```

### Run the Application
