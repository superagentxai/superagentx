ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides IT service management (ITSM), helping organizations manage incidents, assets, changes, and workflows. The `ServiceNowHandler` allows seamless integration with ServiceNow to fetch users, assets, and related tickets programmatically.

## Example

To create the `ServiceNowHandler` object, initialize it with your ServiceNow instance URL and credentials. If not provided, the values will be picked up from environment variables.

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.servicenow import ServiceNowHandler

servicenow_handler = ServiceNowHandler(
    instance_url=os.getenv("SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL"),
    username=os.getenv("SERVICENOW_USERNAME"),
    password=os.getenv("SERVICENOW_PASSWORD"),
)
```

**Get User Name:** <br />
Fetches the userâ€™s display name from ServiceNow using their sys_id.
```python
user_name = await servicenow_handler.get_user_name("46d44a2d1b2123009b5f3d92cc4bcb65")
print(user_name)   # e.g., "John Doe"
```

**Get Assets with Details and Tickets:** <br />
Retrieves a list of assets along with details like owner, model, warranty, and their associated incident tickets.
```python
assets_report = await servicenow_handler.get_assets_with_details_and_tickets()
for asset in assets_report:
    print(asset["Asset Name"], asset["Tickets"])
```
