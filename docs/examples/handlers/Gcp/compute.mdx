Google Cloud Compute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering from GCP that allows you to run virtual machines (VMs), manage disks, networks, firewalls, snapshots, and images.
This handler (`GcpComputeHandler`) provides methods to collect detailed information about Compute resources for governance, auditing, and monitoring purposes.

It authenticates using a **GCP service account** and leverages the Google Cloud SDK (`google-cloud-compute`) to fetch data.

## Example

To create the `GcpComputeHandler` object with your service account:

```python
import os
import json
from superagentx_handlers.gcp.compute import GcpComputeHandler

# Load service account credentials
with open("service_account.json", "r") as f:
    service_account_info = json.load(f)

compute_handler = GcpComputeHandler(service_account_info=service_account_info)
```

**Collect Instances:** <br />
Retrieve details of all VM instances in a project or specific zone.
```python
instances = await compute_handler.collect_instances(project_id="my-project-id", zone="us-central1-a")
print(instances[:2])  # preview first 2 VMs
```

**Collect Disks:** <br />
Fetch persistent disk information across all zones or a specific zone.
```python
disks = await compute_handler.collect_disks(project_id="my-project-id")
print(disks[:2])  # preview first 2 disks
```

**Collect Networks:** <br />
Get all VPC networks within a project.
```python
networks = await compute_handler.collect_networks(project_id="my-project-id")
print(networks)
```

**Collect Subnetworks:** <br />
Retrieve subnetworks across all regions or a specific region.
```python
subnets = await compute_handler.collect_subnetworks(project_id="my-project-id", region="us-central1")
print(subnets[:2])
```

**Collect Firewall Rules:** <br />
Fetch firewall rules that define ingress/egress traffic control for resources.
```python
firewalls = await compute_handler.collect_firewall_rules(project_id="my-project-id")
print(firewalls[:2])
```

**Collect Images:** <br />
Retrieve custom images created in the project.
```python
images = await compute_handler.collect_images(project_id="my-project-id")
print(images)
```

**Collect Snapshots:** <br />
Fetch disk snapshots for backup and disaster recovery.
```python
snapshots = await compute_handler.collect_snapshots(project_id="my-project-id")
print(snapshots)
```

**Collect All Compute Info:** <br />
Retrieve a comprehensive dictionary with all compute resources (instances, disks, networks, subnetworks, firewalls, images, and snapshots).
```python
all_compute_info = await compute_handler.collect_all_compute_info(project_id="my-project-id")
print(all_compute_info.keys())
```
