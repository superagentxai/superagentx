Google Calendar is a scheduling and time-management service that allows users to create, manage, and share events. It provides features like reminders, recurring events, and integration with other Google Workspace services. With the `CalenderHandler`, you can connect to Google Calendar via OAuth 2.0 and programmatically fetch events for a day, week, month, or specific type.

## Example

To create the `CalenderHandler` object, initialize it with your Google OAuth credentials file. The handler manages authentication and provides methods to retrieve events from Google Calendar.

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.gcp.calendar import CalenderHandler

calendar_handler = CalenderHandler(
    credentials="credentials.json"   # Path to Google OAuth client secrets file
)
```

**Get Todayâ€™s Events:** <br />
Retrieves all events scheduled for today.
```python
events_today = await calendar_handler.get_today_events()
print(events_today)
```

**Get Week Events:** <br />
Retrieves all events scheduled for the next 7 days.
```python
events_week = await calendar_handler.get_week_events()
print(events_week)
```

**Get Month Events:** <br />
Retrieves all events scheduled for the next 30 days.
```python
events_month = await calendar_handler.get_month_events()
print(events_month)
```

**Get Events by Custom Days:** <br />
Fetches events for a custom range between 1 and 30 days.
```python
events_5days = await calendar_handler.get_events_by_days(days=5)
print(events_5days)
```

**Get Events by Type:** <br />
Fetches events of a specific type such as "birthday", "focusTime", or "workingLocation".
```python
birthday_events = await calendar_handler.get_events_by_type(event_type="birthday")
print(birthday_events)
```
