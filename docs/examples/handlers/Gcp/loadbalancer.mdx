Google Cloud Load Balancer is a fully distributed, software-defined managed service for distributing traffic across multiple instances, services, and regions.
It supports HTTP(S), TCP/SSL, and UDP load balancing, integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud services, and provides **high availability, scalability, and global reach**.

The `GCPLoadBalancerHandler` provides programmatic access to **all load balancer components**, including URL maps, backend services, proxies, forwarding rules, SSL certificates, and health checks.


## Example

To create the `GCPLoadBalancerHandler` with Google Cloud credentials:

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.gcp.load_balancer import GCPLoadBalancerHandler

# Initialize handler with a service account file
handler = GCPLoadBalancerHandler(
    creds=os.getenv("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
)
```

**List All Load Balancer Components:** <br />
Fetches all components (URL maps, backend services, proxies, SSL certs, health checks) concurrently.
```python
components = await handler.list_all_load_balancer_components()
print(components.keys())
# Output: dict with url_maps, backend_services, proxies, ssl_certificates, health_checks
```

**Get URL Maps (Application Load Balancers):** <br />
Retrieves URL maps including host rules, path matchers, and route actions.
```python
url_maps = await handler.get_url_maps()
print(url_maps)
```

**Get Backend Services:** <br />
Fetches backend services with protocols, ports, CDN settings, session affinity, and backend group details.
```python
backends = await handler.get_backend_services()
print(backends)
```

**Get Target HTTP Proxies:** <br />
Lists all HTTP proxies linked to URL maps.
```python
http_proxies = await handler.get_target_http_proxies()
print(http_proxies)
```

**Get Target HTTPS Proxies:** <br />
Lists all HTTPS proxies along with SSL certificates and QUIC override settings.
```python
https_proxies = await handler.get_target_https_proxies()
print(https_proxies)
```

**Get Global Forwarding Rules:** <br />
Fetches forwarding rules with IP addresses, protocols, port ranges, and targets.
```python
rules = await handler.get_global_forwarding_rules()
print(rules)
```

**Get SSL Certificates:** <br />
Retrieves SSL certificates (truncated for security) with SANs and expiration details.
```python
certs = await handler.get_ssl_certificates()
print(certs)
```

**Get Health Checks:** <br />
Lists health checks with thresholds, intervals, timeouts, and protocol-specific details (HTTP/HTTPS).
```python
health_checks = await handler.get_health_checks()
print(health_checks)
```
