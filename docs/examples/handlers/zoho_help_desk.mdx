Zoho Desk is a cloud-based help desk platform used to manage customer support tickets, workflows, and automation.
The ZohoHelpDeskHandler provides a structured interface for interacting with the Zoho Desk REST API, enabling agent-driven and
automated ticket management.

This handler supports secure OAuth-based authentication and exposes tool-enabled methods to retrieve, update, and transition tickets
across statuses, process stages, and blueprint workflows.

## Example

## Initialize ZohoHelpDeskHandler
Create the handler using explicit parameters.

```python
from superagentx_handlers.zoho.helpdesk import ZohoHelpDeskHandler

zoho_handler = ZohoHelpDeskHandler(
    org_id="123456789",
    auth_token="your_oauth_access_token"
)
```

## Get Ticket

**Retrieve a Ticket by ID:** <br />
Fetches full ticket details including status, fields, and metadata.

```python
ticket = zoho_handler.get_ticket("987654321")
print(ticket["subject"], ticket["status"])
```

## Update Ticket

**Update Ticket Fields:** <br />
Allows updating any mutable ticket field such as priority, description, or custom fields.

```python
updated_ticket = zoho_handler.update_ticket(
    ticket_id="987654321",
    fields={
        "priority": "High",
        "description": "Issue escalated for immediate attention"
    }
)
print(updated_ticket)
```

## Change Ticket Status

**Update Ticket Status:** <br />
Transitions a ticket between standard statuses like Open, In Progress, or Closed.

```python
zoho_handler.change_status(
    ticket_id="987654321",
    status="In Progress"
)
```

## Change Process Stage

**Move Ticket to Custom Process Stage:** <br />
Updates a custom field representing internal workflow stages.

```python
zoho_handler.change_process_stage(
    ticket_id="987654321",
    stage_name="L2 Review"
)
```

## Trigger Blueprint Transition

**Execute a Blueprint Transition:** <br />
Triggers a Zoho Blueprint workflow transition using a transition ID.

```python
response = zoho_handler.trigger_blueprint_transition(
    ticket_id="987654321",
    transition_id="456789012"
)
print(response)
)
```
