Zoho People (Zoho HIRS) is a cloud-based Human Resource Information System that helps organizations manage employees, onboarding, offboarding, and role changes. Using the Zoho People API, you can programmatically access employee records, workflows, and other HR-related data.

## Example

To create the `ZohoHIRSHandler` object, initialize it with your Zoho **access token**.
The handler provides methods for fetching employee records and HR workflows.

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.zoho.hirs import ZohoHIRSHandler

zoho_handler = ZohoHIRSHandler(
    access_token=os.getenv("ZOHO_PEOPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN")
)
```

**List Employees:** <br />
Retrieves the list of all employees in the Zoho People organization.
```python
employees = await zoho_handler.list_employees()
for emp in employees:
    print(emp["Name"], emp["Email"])
```

**List Onboarding Workflows:** <br />
Fetches onboarding workflows configured in Zoho People.
```python
onboarding_flows = await zoho_handler.list_onboarding_workflows()
print(onboarding_flows)
```

**List Offboarding Workflows:** <br />
Fetches offboarding workflows configured in Zoho People.
```python
offboarding_flows = await zoho_handler.list_offboarding_workflows()
print(offboarding_flows)
```

**List Role Change Workflows:** <br />
Retrieves role change (transfer) workflows configured in Zoho People.
```python
role_change_flows = await zoho_handler.list_role_change_workflows()
print(role_change_flows)
```
