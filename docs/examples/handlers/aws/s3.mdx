Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service on AWS that lets you store different types of files, like photos, audio, and
videos, as objects. It offers high scalability and security, making it easy to store and access any amount of data
from anywhere, anytime. S3 also provides features like high availability, strong security, and smooth integration with
other AWS services.

(access key, secret key) and specifies a region and bucket name. It enables
seamless interaction with S3 for tasks like uploading, downloading, and
managing files.

```python s3_handler_test.py
import os

from superagentx_handlers.aws.s3 import AWSS3Handler


s3_handler = AWSS3Handler(
        aws_access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
        aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
        bucket_name="test",
        region_name="eu-central-1"
)
```

```

**Download File:** <br />
The Download_file method accepts a file download in the buckets
```python
