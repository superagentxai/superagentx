Amazon CloudFront is a fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications,
and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. CloudFront works seamlessly with services
like S3, API Gateway, and ACM for SSL/TLS certificates.

## Example
To create the AWSCloudFrontHandler object with AWS credentials.
The AWSCloudFrontHandler enables you to interact with CloudFront for tasks such as
listing distributions, cache behaviors, access control settings, and certificates.

```python cloudfront_handler_test.py
import os

from superagentx_handlers.aws.cloudfront import AWSCloudFrontHandler


cloudfront_handler = AWSCloudFrontHandler(
    aws_access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
    region_name="us-east-1"
)
```

**List Distributions:** <br />
The list_distributions method retrieves all CloudFront distributions.
```python
distributions = await cloudfront_handler.list_distributions()
print(distributions)
```

**List Certificates:** <br />
The list_certificates method retrieves all ACM-managed certificates in us-east-1,
typically used with CloudFront.
```python
certificates = await cloudfront_handler.list_certificates()
print(certificates)
```

**List Cache Behaviors:** <br />
The list_cache_behaviors method shows default and ordered cache behaviors for all distributions.
```python
cache_behaviors = await cloudfront_handler.list_cache_behaviors()
print(cache_behaviors)
```

**List Access Control Configurations:** <br />
The list_access_control_configs method retrieves access control settings like geo-restrictions and WAF associations.
```python
access_controls = await cloudfront_handler.list_access_control_configs()
print(access_controls)
```
