Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud.
It supports multiple engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server, and provides features such as automated backups, scaling, monitoring, and high availability.


## Example

To create the **RDS Handler**, you must pass AWS credentials (`access_key`, `secret_key`, and `region`).
This enables you to interact with RDS resources, clusters, proxies, and their associations with EC2.

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.aws.rds import AWSRDSHandler

rds_handler = AWSRDSHandler(
    aws_access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
    region_name="eu-central-1"
)
```
**Get RDS Association Details:** <br />
Provides a comprehensive inventory of RDS resources and their associations.
```python
details = await rds_handler.get_rds_association_details()
print(details)
```

**List RDS Instances:** <br />
Fetches all RDS database instances in the account.
```python
instances = await rds_handler.get_rds_instances()
print(instances)
```

**List RDS Clusters:** <br />
Fetches all Aurora RDS clusters.
```python
clusters = await rds_handler.get_rds_clusters()
print(clusters)
```

**List RDS Proxies:** <br />
Fetches all RDS database proxies.
```python
proxies = await rds_handler.get_rds_proxies()
print(proxies)
```

**Get Proxy Targets:** <br />
Retrieves targets associated with a specific RDS proxy.
```python
targets = await rds_handler.get_proxy_targets(
    proxy_name="my-rds-proxy"
)
print(targets)
```

**Get EC2 Associations:** <br />
Finds EC2 instances that are associated with RDS security groups.
```python
associations = await rds_handler.get_ec2_associations(
    rds_instances=instances
)
print(associations)
```

**Get Backup Configuration:** <br />
Fetches backup details such as retention period, backup window, and maintenance window for an RDS instance or cluster.
```python
backup = await rds_handler.get_backup_config(
    db_identifier="my-db-instance",
    is_cluster=False  # set True for clusters
)
print(backup)
```
