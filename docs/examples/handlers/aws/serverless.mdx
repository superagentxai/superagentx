AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You just upload your code (as a ZIP package or container image), and Lambda automatically scales and runs it in response to events such as API Gateway requests, S3 object uploads, DynamoDB streams, or scheduled CloudWatch events.

Lambda integrates seamlessly with **VPC, IAM, Security Groups, and other AWS services**, making it a core component of modern serverless applications.



## Example

To create the AWSLambdaHandler with AWS credentials:

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.aws.serverless import AWSLambdaHandler

lambda_handler = AWSLambdaHandler(
    aws_access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
    region_name="eu-central-1"
)
```

**List Lambda Functions:** <br/>
Retrieves all Lambda functions in the account, including runtime, handler, role, security groups, IAM policies, and environment configurations.
```python
functions = await lambda_handler.get_lambda_functions()
print(functions)
```

**Get IAM Role Policies for a Lambda Role:** <br/>
Fetches all attached and inline IAM policies for the IAM role associated with a Lambda.
```python
policies = await lambda_handler.get_role_policies("MyLambdaRole")
print(policies)
```

**Get Security Group Details:** <br/>
Fetches inbound/outbound rules for security groups attached to a Lambda functionâ€™s VPC.
```python
sg_details = await lambda_handler.get_security_group_details(["sg-12345678"])
print(sg_details)
```
