The **AWS Helper** provides utility functions to simplify authentication and temporary credential generation.
One key feature is the ability to generate **AWS STS temporary credentials**, which are short-lived credentials used for secure authentication in AWS services without exposing long-term access keys.

STS (Security Token Service) is particularly useful when granting temporary access to applications, scripts, or external systems.

## Example

To use the AWS Helper, call the `generate_aws_sts_token` method with your AWS credentials and region details.

```python
import os
from helpers.aws_helper import generate_aws_sts_token

# Generate temporary STS token
sts_credentials = generate_aws_sts_token(
    region_name="us-east-1",
    aws_access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
    duration_seconds=3600  # 1 hour
)

print(sts_credentials)
```
