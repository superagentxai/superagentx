GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides Git repository management, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and more. It enables teams to collaborate on code, automate software delivery, and enforce security and compliance policies. Using the GitLab API, you can programmatically manage projects, users, groups, pipelines, and repository data for governance and auditing.

## Example

To create the `GitlabHandler` object, initialize it with your GitLab private token and instance URL. The handler authenticates with GitLab and provides methods to fetch projects, issues, merge requests, and more.

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.gitlab import GitlabHandler

gitlab_handler = GitlabHandler(
    private_token=os.getenv("GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN"),
    url="https://gitlab.com"
)
```

**Get User Profile:** <br />
Retrieves the full authenticated GitLab user profile.
```python
user = await gitlab_handler.get_user_profile()
print(user["username"], user["email"])
```

**Get Projects:** <br />
Lists all projects owned by the authenticated user.
```python
projects = await gitlab_handler.get_projects()
print([p["name"] for p in projects])
```

**Get Groups and Members:** <br />
Lists groups owned by the user and their members.
```python
groups = await gitlab_handler.get_groups_and_members()
print(groups)
```

**Get Issues:** <br />
Fetches issues for a specific project or across all accessible projects.
```python
issues = await gitlab_handler.get_issues(project_id=12345)
print([i["title"] for i in issues])
```

**Get Merge Requests:** <br />
Fetches merge requests for a project or across all projects.
```python
mrs = await gitlab_handler.get_merge_requests(project_id=12345)
print([mr["title"] for mr in mrs])
```

**Get Hooks:** <br />
Retrieves webhooks configured for a project (or all projects).
```python
hooks = await gitlab_handler.get_hooks(project_id=12345)
print(hooks)
```

**Get Pipelines:** <br />
Lists recent pipelines for a project or across all accessible projects.
```python
pipelines = await gitlab_handler.get_pipelines(project_id=12345)
print(pipelines)
```

**Get Branches:** <br />
Fetches all branches for a project or across all projects.
```python
branches = await gitlab_handler.get_branches(project_id=12345)
print([b["name"] for b in branches])
```

**Get Branch Protection Rules:** <br />
Fetches branch protection rules for a project (or all projects).
```python
rules = await gitlab_handler.get_branch_protection_rules(project_id=12345)
print(rules)
```

**Get Packages:** <br />
Lists all packages published to GitLabâ€™s package registry for a project or across projects.
```python
packages = await gitlab_handler.get_packages(project_id=12345)
print([pkg["name"] for pkg in packages])
```
