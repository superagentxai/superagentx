Datadog Incidents is a service that helps engineering and operations teams track, manage, and resolve incidents efficiently.
It provides powerful integrations, collaborative workflows, and monitoring visibility to ensure quick resolution of critical issues.

This handler allows seamless interaction with **Datadog Incidents API**, enabling you to **list** and **search** incidents programmatically.
It uses API and Application keys for authentication (`DD_API_KEY`, `DD_APP_KEY`) and requires the `DD_SITE` configuration (e.g., `us5.datadoghq.com`).



## Example

To create the `DDIncidentsHandler` object with Datadog credentials:

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.datadog.incidents import DDIncidentsHandler

dd_handler = DDIncidentsHandler(
    host=os.getenv("DD_SITE"),  # e.g., "us5.datadoghq.com"
    api_key=os.getenv("DD_API_KEY"),
    app_key=os.getenv("DD_APP_KEY")
)
```
**List Incidents (list_incidents):** <br />
Retrieves a list of all incidents in your Datadog account.
```python
incidents = await dd_handler.list_incidents()
print(incidents)
```

**Search Incidents (search_incidents):** <br />
Search for incidents that match a specific query (by title, status, severity, etc.).
```python
results = await dd_handler.search_incidents(query="status:active severity:SEV-1")
print(results)
```
