WhatsApp is one of the most widely used messaging platforms for real-time communication. The WhatsAppHandler enables agents and
automation workflows to send WhatsApp text messages programmatically using the WhatsApp Cloud API.

This handler abstracts authentication, request formatting, and error handling, allowing seamless integration with WhatsApp for
notifications, alerts, approvals, and conversational workflows.

## Example

## Initialize WhatsAppHandler
Create the handler using explicit parameters or environment variables.

```python
from superagentx_handlers.communication.whatsapp import WhatsappHandler

whatsapp_handler = WhatsappHandler(
    phone_number_id="123456789012345",
    access_token="your_access_token"
)
```

## Send WhatsApp Message

**Send a Text Message:** <br />
Sends a plain text message to a WhatsApp user using their phone number in E.164 format.

```python
response = await whatsapp_handler.send_whatsapp_message(
    to_number="919876543210",
    message_text="🚀 Your deployment completed successfully!"
)
print(response)
```
