Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is a core networking feature in Microsoft Azure that acts as a virtual firewall.
It controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources such as Virtual Machines, Subnets, and NICs.
The `AzureNSGHandler` makes it easy to authenticate with Azure using service principal credentials and retrieve
all NSGs within a subscription, helping with **network security auditing** and **firewall configuration visibility**.

## Example

To create the `AzureNSGHandler` object, provide your Azure credentials (subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret).
These can also be loaded from environment variables:

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.azure.nsg import AzureNSGHandler

nsg_handler = AzureNSGHandler(
    subscription_id=os.getenv("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"),
    tenant_id=os.getenv("AZURE_TENANT_ID"),
    client_id=os.getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=os.getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)
```

**List All Network Security Groups (NSGs):** <br />
Retrieves a list of all NSGs in the subscription. Each NSG includes its rules and properties.
```python
nsgs = await nsg_handler.get_network_security_groups()
print(nsgs)
```
