Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It provides features like SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, URL-based routing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration to protect against common exploits and vulnerabilities. With Application Gateway, you can secure, scale, and monitor your application traffic efficiently in Azure.

## Example

To create the AzureApplicationGatewayHandler object with Azure credentials. The handler connects to Azure Application Gateway resources using client credentials or managed identity, and provides methods to fetch gateways, backend health, WAF policies, and networking components.

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.azure.application_gateway import AzureApplicationGatewayHandler

gateway_handler = AzureApplicationGatewayHandler(
    subscription_id=os.getenv("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"),
    client_id=os.getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=os.getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
    tenant_id=os.getenv("AZURE_TENANT_ID"),
)
```

**Get Resource Groups:** <br />
Retrieve all resource groups in the subscription.
```python
groups = await gateway_handler.get_resource_groups()
print(groups)
```

**List Application Gateways:** <br />
Fetch all Application Gateways in the subscription or within a resource group.
```python
app_gateways = await gateway_handler.get_application_gateways(resource_group_name="my-rg")
print(app_gateways)
```

**Get Application Gateway Details:** <br />
Fetch detailed info for a specific Application Gateway.
```python
gateway = await gateway_handler.get_application_gateway(resource_group_name="my-rg", gateway_name="my-gateway")
print(gateway)
```

**Check Backend Health:** <br />
Retrieve backend pool health information for a gateway.
```python
health = await gateway_handler.get_application_gateway_backend_health(resource_group_name="my-rg", gateway_name="my-gateway")
print(health)
```

**Get WAF Policies:** <br />
List all WAF policies associated with Application Gateways.
```python
waf_policies = await gateway_handler.get_application_gateway_waf_policies(resource_group_name="my-rg")
print(waf_policies)
```

**Get Public IPs:** <br />
Retrieve public IP addresses available for Application Gateways.
```python
public_ips = await gateway_handler.get_public_ip_addresses(resource_group_name="my-rg")
print(public_ips)
```

**Get Virtual Networks:** <br />
List all VNets and subnets associated with Application Gateways.
```python
vnets = await gateway_handler.get_virtual_networks(resource_group_name="my-rg")
print(vnets)
```

**Start Application Gateway:** <br />
Start an Application Gateway instance.
```python
await gateway_handler.start_application_gateway(resource_group_name="my-rg", gateway_name="my-gateway")
```

**Stop Application Gateway:** <br />
Stop an Application Gateway instance.
```python
await gateway_handler.stop_application_gateway(resource_group_name="my-rg", gateway_name="my-gateway")
```

**Collect All Data:** <br />
Fetch comprehensive data including gateways, WAF policies, backend health, public IPs, and VNets.
```python
data = await gateway_handler.collect_all_application_gateway_data(resource_group_name="my-rg")
print(data)
```

**Authentication & Authorization Details:** <br />
Collect authentication, authorization, and RBAC configuration details for API Management linked with gateways.
```python
auth_data = await gateway_handler.collect_authentication_authorization_details(resource_group_name="my-rg")
print(auth_data)
```
