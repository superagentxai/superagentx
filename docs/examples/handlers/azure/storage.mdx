Azure Storage Accounts are scalable cloud storage solutions in Microsoft Azure,
commonly used to store **blobs (files), queues, tables, and file shares**.
The `AzureStorageHandler` provides an abstraction layer to authenticate with Azure using
service principal credentials and retrieve all storage accounts within a subscription,
including their **encryption settings, firewall/network rules, and public access status**.

## Example

To create the `AzureStorageHandler` object, provide your Azure credentials
(subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret).
These can also be loaded from environment variables:

```python
import os
from superagentx_handlers.azure.storage import AzureStorageHandler

storage_handler = AzureStorageHandler(
    subscription_id=os.getenv("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"),
    tenant_id=os.getenv("AZURE_TENANT_ID"),
    client_id=os.getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=os.getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)
```
**List All Storage Accounts:** <br />
Retrieves a list of all storage accounts within the subscription,
along with their associated properties.
```python
accounts = await storage_handler.list_storage_accounts()
print(accounts)
```
