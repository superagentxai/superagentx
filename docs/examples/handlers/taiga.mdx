Taiga is an open-source project management platform built for agile teams. It supports epics, user stories,
tasks, and issues with configurable workflows.The TaigaHandler provides an asynchronous interface to the
Taiga REST API, enabling secure authentication and efficient retrieval of project and workflow data for
automation and agent-driven workflows.

## Example

To create a TaigaHandler, initialize it with your Taiga username and password.
The handler authenticates automatically and reuses a single HTTP session for optimal performance.

```python
from superagentx_handlers.taiga import TaigaHandler

taiga_handler = TaigaHandler(
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)
```

**Get Projects:** <br />
Retrieves all projects where the authenticated user is a member.

```python
projects = await taiga_handler.get_projects()
for project in projects:
    print(project["name"])
```

**Get Workflow Stages:** <br />
Fetches workflow stages for a specific project and entity type.
```python
stages = await taiga_handler.get_stages(
    kind="task-statuses",
    project_id=12345
)
print(stages)
```

**Get All Processes:** <br />
Aggregates all workflow stages (epics, user stories, tasks, and issues) across every project the user belongs to.
```python
processes = await taiga_handler.get_all_processes()

for project, workflows in processes.items():
    print(project, workflows.keys())
```

**Session Management:**<br />
The handler maintains a reusable asynchronous HTTP session and handles authentication transparently.
To gracefully close the session:
```python
await taiga_handler.close()
```
