An `Agent` from `superagentx.agent` is a system or program that is initialized with specific goals and roles, enabling it to interact with a
large language model (LLM) and use a predefined prompt template. It is designed to perform agent by following a
set of instructions and can be customized with various parameters to adapt its behavior to different agent or
workflows. Essentially, the `agent` acts as a flexible tool that can be fine-tuned to carry out specific functions
based on the needs of the user.

```
## Agent Configuration

### Sequence
In sequence execution, `engine(s)` are performed one after another, with each `engine(s)` waiting for the
previous one to finish before starting. This approach is simple but can be slow if `engine(s)` are independent.

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    engines=[engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n],
    ...
)

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    ...
)

await agent.add(engine_1, engine_2, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.
.
await agent.add(engine_3, engine_4, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, engine_2, engine_3, engine_4]
```

### Parallel
In parallel execution, `engine(s)` run at the same time, speeding up the process by utilizing multiple threads or processes.

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    engines=[[engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n]],
    ...
)

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [[engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n]]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    ...
)

await agent.add(engine_1, engine_2, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

await agent.add(engine_3, engine_4, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [[agent_1, engine_2, engine_3, engine_4]]
```

### Mixed with Sequence and Parallel

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    engines=[engine_1, [engine_2, engine_3], engine_4 ... engine_n],
    ...
)

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, [engine_2, engine_3], engine_4, ... engine_nm]]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    ...
)

await agent.add(engine_1, engine_2, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.
.
await agent.add(engine_3, engine_4, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, engine_2, [engine_3, engine_4]]
```

## Task Agent

In SuperAgentX, a task agent is a focused, self-contained component that executes a complete workflow from start to
finish. It receives an input or trigger, applies decision logic, and uses SuperAgentX handlers and tools to interact
with external systems such as APIs, databases, or messaging services. Task agents are typically asynchronous and
event-driven, enabling reliable automation of monitoring, processing, and orchestration tasks with minimal human
intervention.


```python
    task_agent = Agent(engines=[engine])
```


## Browser Agent
In SuperAgentX, a browser agent is a specialized agent designed to interact with web interfaces just like a human user.
It can navigate pages, fill forms, click buttons, extract data, and handle multi-step web workflows using a controlled
browser environment. Browser agents are used when APIs are unavailable or insufficient, enabling automated web actions
such as scraping, verification, onboarding, and portal-based operations within a larger task workflow.


```python
    browser_agent = Agent(
        name="Review & Pay Agent",
        role="Browser Payment Executor",
        goal="Review checkout and pay using credit card",
        llm=llm,
        human_approval=True,   # governance point
        prompt_template=browser_prompt,
        engines=[browser_engine],
        max_retry=2
    )
```
