In SuperAgentX, Human-in-the-Loop approval is used as a governance step inside a task or browser agent workflow.
When the agent reaches a sensitive operation (for example: deleting data, triggering payments, or sending external
communications), execution is automatically paused. A human approval request is raised through a configured channel
(UI, notification, or dashboard), and the agent waits for a decision. Once approval is received, the agent resumes
execution; if rejected, the workflow is safely stopped. All approval actions are logged, making the process transparent,
auditable, and fully controlled by humans.
